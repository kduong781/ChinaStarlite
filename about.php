		Our restaurant was founded by rural, hardworking country folk with a dream of feeding fellow villagers with delicious, authentic chinese food. As popularity began to grow,
		the opportunity to buy a small restaurant space popped up and word around the new location quickly spread of an amazing restaurant opening it's doors. The business thrived,
		exceeding highest expectations, to where the restaurant was known throughout China. As five generations past, the restaurant and the brand is still owned and ran by the originating family
		all while still keeping to the traditions that garnered such attention. Now we have expanded to Long Beach, California to share the authentic taste of China with amazing hospitality and
		ingredients freshly imported from our home country. Enjoy.
